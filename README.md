- 👋 Hi, I’m @SumiIsmaell
- 👀 I’m interested in trying more interesting projects to practice my skills. At the moment I am learning JavaScript, I need to find projects that can challenge my skills and help me learn more.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript on Codecademy, I am also trying to create more projects on Visual studios, and eventually QtDesigner.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on fun and challenging projects!
